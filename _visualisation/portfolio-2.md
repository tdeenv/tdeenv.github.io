Using Tableau I created a dashboard to visualise where Australian financial services licences are registered based on publically available information. I also included the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia rating for each location.

The vast majority of AFS licences are registered along the east coast of Australia in Victoria and New South Wales. When valid registration post codes are compared with their ARIA scores, it isn't particularly surprising that most licences fall in the "(0) Major City" category, though there are also several registered in "(1) Inner regional" and "(2) Outer regional" areas as well.
