About me
=============


I am  a student at the University of Sydney where I study a Bachelor of Economics majoring in Economics and Econometrics. I am passionate about data science, public policy, and social impact. 

In my spare time I enjoy listening to music (hiphop, techno, synthwave, metal), reading (sci-fi, cyberpunk, economics), woodworking and boxing.
