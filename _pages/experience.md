### Public policy and evaluation
In 2019, during my first year at university, I started working part-time at a boutique public policy consulting firm called ARTD Consultants. I began as an intern, and then moved to a research assistant role before I was promoted to analyst. At ARTD I worked on evaluating public policies and programs across a variety of sectors including:
1. Health,
2. Transport, infrastructure and regional development,
3. Environment and natural resources,
4. Disability and ageing,
5. Education and youth development.

I also contributed to a blog reflecting on my experiences during my first year at the company. You can find it <a href="https://www.artd.com.au/news/our-first-year-at-artd-2/">**here**</a>. Working on the quantitative analysis for projects also led me to realise that I really enjoyed working with data, which in turn drove my decision to change degrees from a major in international business to a major in econometrics.

### Market research
I have also worked on a part time contract as an insights analyst in the consumer intelligence and consulting team at Gfk. I wrote reports for clients, analysed survey data, assisted with questionnaire development and helped maintain brand health trackers.
