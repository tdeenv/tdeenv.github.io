The Muay-Thai-Trainer project is a handy Python tool for generating random Muay Thai combos to make training sessions more exciting. 


I wanted to learn how to make a UI for python scripts and through my research I landed on the "eel" package.The Random combinations are generated using Python's "random" package,
while the web-style interfaces uses JavaScript and HTML, enabbled by the eel package which allows the python backend to communicate with the JavaScript front end in an offline format.

The video below shows it in action.
